	Peter Rousseeuw, Anja Struyf and Mia Hubert,

  <tr> <td> dashboardthemes </td> <td> 1.1.5 </td> <td> Allows manual creation of themes and logos to be used in
    applications created using the 'shinydashboard' package. Removes the need to
    change the underlying css code by wrapping it into a set of convenient R
    functions. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> DT </td> <td> 0.23 </td> <td> Data objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the
    JavaScript library 'DataTables' (typically via R Markdown or Shiny). The
    'DataTables' library has been included in this R package. The package name
    'DT' is an abbreviation of 'DataTables'. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> huge </td> <td> 1.3.5 </td> <td> Provides a general framework for
        high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. It integrates
        data preprocessing, neighborhood screening, graph estimation,
        and model selection techniques into a pipeline. In
        preprocessing stage, the nonparanormal(npn) transformation is
        applied to help relax the normality assumption. In the graph
        estimation stage, the graph structure is estimated by
        Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation or the graphical lasso,
        and both methods can be further accelerated by the lossy
        screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable
        by correlation thresholding. We target on high-dimensional data
        analysis usually d &gt;&gt; n, and the computation is
        memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also
        provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation
        thresholding graph estimation. Three
        regularization/thresholding parameter selection methods are
        included in this package: (1)stability approach for
        regularization selection (2) rotation information criterion (3)
        extended Bayesian information criterion which is only available
        for the graphical lasso. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> lubridate </td> <td> 1.8.0 </td> <td> Functions to work with date-times and time-spans:
    fast and user friendly parsing of date-time data, extraction and
    updating of components of a date-time (years, months, days, hours,
    minutes, and seconds), algebraic manipulation on date-time and
    time-span objects. The 'lubridate' package has a consistent and
    memorable syntax that makes working with dates easy and fun.  Parts of
    the 'CCTZ' source code, released under the Apache 2.0 License, are
    included in this package. See &lt;https://github.com/google/cctz&gt; for
    more details. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> magic </td> <td> 1.6.0 </td> <td> A collection of functions for the manipulation and
 analysis of arbitrarily dimensioned arrays.  The original motivation
 for the package was the development of efficient, vectorized
 algorithms for the creation and investigation of magic squares and
 high-dimensional magic hypercubes. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> PerformanceAnalytics </td> <td> 2.0.4 </td> <td> Collection of econometric functions for performance and risk 
    analysis. In addition to standard risk and performance metrics, this 
    package aims to aid practitioners and researchers in utilizing the latest
    research in analysis of non-normal return streams.  In general, it is most 
    tested on return (rather than price) data on a regular scale, but most 
    functions will work with irregular return data as well, and increasing
    numbers of functions will work with P&amp;L or price data where possible. </td> </tr>
